            <h2>Mission</h2>
            <p>SUST Cybersecurity Club focuses on learning and spreading knowledge of different aspect of cyber security.
                <br /> <br />
                It is runned by a group of students who have strong enthusiasms in computer, network, hardware, software, mobile and internet of things (IoT)  security.
                <br /> <br />
                The purpose of this organization is to facilitate students’ cybersecurity research and practice, learn about security tools and protocols, penetration testing and especially to prepare students for the cybersecurity competitions such Capture The Flag (CTF), and others.
                <br /> <br />
                This is a community for aspiring security enthusiasts, and for those wanting to understand the realm of information security to apply in information technology, day to day life and business process</p>
